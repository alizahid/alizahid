WoWdb is a World of Warcraft database in your pocket. It lets you search for items, quests, achievements, mounts, and more, and view details and stats and [Wowhead](https://wowhead.com) comments for everything in the game.

[Read more](/blog/building-wowdb) about the architecture on my blog.

WoWdb is built using Fastify, MongoDB, React Native, and [Fuzzy](https://github.com/jeancroy/FuzzySearch) for search.
