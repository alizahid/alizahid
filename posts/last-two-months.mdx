excerpt: What I've been up to for the last two months and why I've abandoned all my goals.

The last two months have been a bit crazy.

I was supposed to take some time off work and recharge since last year was hectic. But the timing didn't work out, and I ended up burning myself out.

I'm kind of back with new energy, however, without the break that I still need.

A lot of exciting stuff has happened over the last couple of weeks.

### TypeScript

I finally got around to learning TypeScript. I am absolutely in love. I've built a few prototypes and experiments with React / React Native and TypeScript. I've yet to use TypeScript in a serverside project, but that's happening soon.

### GraphQL

I've also been experimenting with GraphQL lately. I'm not quite fully there yet, but it's been interesting. Which means I have no idea what I'm doing so far.

At work, we're rebuilding one of our products soon. I've planning to use the latest and greatest tech; TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL (it's cool again, right?), Kubernetes (why not?), React, and Relay. Out of these, I've never worked with Relay before, so looking forward to that.

### Experiments

I now realize my goal of publishing an app every month was far too ambitious. Between work and recharging myself, there isn't enough time to build, publish, and maintain quality apps. And I don't want to clutter my App Store account with garbage. With that said, my new strategy is to build apps and open-source them. Each experiment using a different bunch of technologies that I want to learn or play with, preferably new stuff.

### Diving

I went scuba diving for the first time. It was a fantastic but rocky experience. Took me several minutes and a small panic attack before I could stabilize my breathing with the regulator. Would recommend, though.

### Furniture

After years of eyeing it, I finally bought a <Link external href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_eur/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs">Herman Miller Aeron chair</Link>. Along with a height-adjustable desk. The desk is massive and can house both my PC and MacBook setups, which is convenient.

I think that covers the significant updates. I'll be sharing more details about the experiments in different posts soon.
